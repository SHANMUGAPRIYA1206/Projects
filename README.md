Traffic Flow Prediction Model (Transfer Learning)

Developed a traffic flow prediction model utilizing transfer learning, improving prediction accuracy by 65%.
Optimized traffic management systems across a metropolitan area by enhancing resource allocation.
Intelligent Traffic Light Control Algorithm
Designed an algorithm that reduces vehicle wait times by 40% during peak hours, improving traffic flow and commuter satisfaction in a major urban corridor.
Crowd-based Traffic Signal Management
Implemented a dynamic traffic signal system based on real-time crowd density at each lane.
Vehicle count is determined using Computer Vision (CV) to capture images of the vehicles and analyze the traffic in the desired lanes, automatically opening lanes based on demand.
